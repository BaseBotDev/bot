# Application Setup
Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and click "New Application".

Name your bot whatever you want and set the avatar to whatever.
Now, head to bot and click "Add Bot".

To add you bot, go to the OAuth2 tab and go to URL generator. Select the bot and application.commands scope.

Select your desired permissions, copy the link and add the bot to any server you want!

# Getting the token
Go to the bot tab and click Reveal Token (will mostly require the OAuth2 code if you have 2FA enabled).

Now head to the ``configs`` folder then to cfg.py and add your token to the TOKEN variable.
